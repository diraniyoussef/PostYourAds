# PostYourAds
A business owner will post ads using an android app, those posts will be structured in a back-end server 
using a database like SQLite, then the client using his own Android app (which should be available in the Google Play Store) 
will see the posts by getting the structured info from the backend server.
We are making this app to sell it to business owners.
